/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The easy fsm creator makes it easy to create mob FSMs in C++ code.
 * For mobs created by the game creator, the state machine is simpler,
 * and written in plain text using a text file. But for the engine and
 * some preset FSMs, like the Pikmin and leader logic, there's no good way
 * to create a finite state machine with something as simple as plain text
 * AND still give the events custom code to run.
 * The only way is to manually create a vector of states, for every
 * state, manually create the events, and for every event, manually
 * create the actions. Boring and ugly. That's why this class was born.
 * Creating a state, event, or action, are now all a single line, much like
 * they would be in a plain text file!
